# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail.
3.  **Generate PRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory.

## Clarifying Questions

Ask questions to understand:
- **Problem & Goal**: What problem does this solve? What's the main objective?
- **The Skateboard Version:** What is the absolute simplest, end-to-end version of this feature that would solve the user's core problem and deliver real value? This is our "Skateboard."
- **User Journey**: What will users see and do when using the "Skateboard"? Walk through the experience.
- **Future Versions (Scooter, Bicycle):** After the Skateboard is built, what would the next logical improvement be?
- **Scope**: What should the "Skateboard" version NOT do?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know the "Skateboard" is working correctly?
- **Edge Cases**: Any special conditions or errors to handle for the "Skateboard"?

## PRD Structure

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Brief description of the feature, the problem it solves, and primary goals.
    - **MUST include a bolded statement:** "**The Skateboard Version:** [One sentence describing the simplest complete solution]"
    - This Skateboard statement should be the most prominent part of the overview
    
2.  **Implementation Phases:** Clear breakdown of how the feature evolves:
    - **Phase 1: The Skateboard** - Describe the MVP (may require multiple tasks to build)
    - **Phase 2: The Scooter** - Describe the enhanced version
    - **Phase 3: The Bicycle** - Describe further improvements (if applicable)
    - Note: Each phase represents a complete, shippable product version

3.  **Goals:** List the objectives for each phase

4.  **User Stories:**
    -   **Start with Skateboard User Stories:** All stories needed for the MVP
    -   **Then Scooter User Stories:** Additional stories for phase 2
    -   **Then Bicycle User Stories:** Further stories for phase 3

5.  **Functional Requirements:**
    -   **Phase 1: The Skateboard (MVP).** Group all requirements for the first, simplest, shippable version here.
        - FR1: [Description]
        - FR2: [Description]
        - Note: These may be implemented across multiple parent tasks
    -   **Phase 2: The Scooter (V2 Enhancement).** Group requirements for the next iteration here.
        - FR3: [Description]
        
6.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope for the Skateboard):** What this feature will NOT include in its first version.

7.  **Design Considerations (Optional):** UI/UX notes, mockups, or component guidelines

8.  **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Known constraints or implementation suggestions

9.  **Success Metrics:** How success will be measured

10.  **Open Questions:** Remaining areas needing clarification

## Output

* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
* **Location:** `/tasks/`
* **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`
* **Audience:** Junior developer (be explicit and avoid jargon)
